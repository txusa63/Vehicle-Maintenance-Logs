# Vehicle-Maintenance-Logs
A vehicle maintenance log system that uses authentication and authorization.

Once an administrator account is created, that admin account is able to see all logs created by the other employees and also look at the profiles of all existing employee accounts. When no account is logged in, the app will direct you to the login page.


When the user logs in as admin, the app will take the user to the dashboard page:

Once at the dashboard the user can either look up all logs currently stored in order of date submitted or the profiles of the employees:

The admin can create a new employee account:

The admin can make changes to an already existing account:

If the user is logged in as an employee then the app will take the user to a page where the user's personal logs are stored:
